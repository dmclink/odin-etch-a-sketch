# odin-etch-a-sketch

[Etcha-a-Sketch project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)
for The Odin Project.

## Usage

View demo hosted on [Github Pages](https://dmclink.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/).

To build on your own, clone the repo and run in live server or host.

Hover mouse over elements to "draw" pixels on the screen.
Optionally use the control panel on the left to change this default input method to
either keyboard via arrow keys, or the knobs.

Clicking on the left half of a knob represents a counter-clockwise turn wheras clicking
the right half of a knob is a clockwise turn. The left knob moves the cursor horizontally
and the right knob moves it vertically painting the "pixels" as it goes.

The control panel on the left also allows changing default full painting of pixels to a
gradual darkening as the cursor moves along them.

Pressing "Clear" button wipes the screen. Pressing "Resize" brings up a prompt to change
the pixel density on the screen (this action also wipes the screen).
